Based on simulated inelastic events
we studied reconstruction efficiency of charged physical primaries selected with cuts
listed in \tab{tab:treackfilterbit}.
Charged physical primaries are  particles produced in a collision including the products of strong 
and  electromagnetic decay and excluding the feed-down from weak decays of strange particles.
The simulation tunes listed in \tab{tab:tunes} were used to get the relation between the number of charged
 physical primaries and the number of charged reconstructed tracks.
Charged physical primaries were identified using the AliRoot function IsPhysicalPrimary. 
Only those charged particles that were emitted to the range $|\eta| < 0.8$ were considered.
 In case of \pp{} and  \ppb{}  collisions event vertex $z$ coordinate was constrained to $\left|z_{vertex}\right|<10$~cm.  

Single track \emph{overall reconstruction correction} takes into account
\begin{itemize}  
\item contamination of the reconstructed track sample with fake primary tracks,
\item track reconstruction efficiency,
\end{itemize}
In following equations $G_{\rm trigvtx}$ stands for the number of true charged physical primaries emitted to  $|\eta|<0.8$
in triggered events where an event vertex was reconstructed. 
Similarly to \cite{JFthesis}, we define the track-to-particle \emph{overall reconstruction correction} 
 $C\left(\pt{}\right)$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  C^{-1}\left( \pt{} \right)&=& { M_{\rm trigvtx}\left(\pt{}\right)+ B\left(\pt{}\right) \over   G_{\rm trigvtx} \left(\pt{}\right)},
 \label{eq:overallC}
\end{eqnarray}

Here $M_{\rm trigvtx}$ denotes the number of properly reconstructed primary tracks\footnote{ 
Reconstructed track that  passed the selection cut  had to have
 an absolute value of assigned label  equal to a label of some MC particle from the input
 MC sample of physical primaries, i.e., charged primary particles emitted to $|\eta|<0.8$.}
and $B$ gives the number of fake and secondary tracks. Let us point out that $G_{\rm trigvtx}$ and $M_{\rm trigvtx}$ are  functions 
of the original MC generator \pt{} while $B$ is a function of the reconstructed \pt{}.
We assume that reconstruction correction of the trigger and associated particle are independent.
Furthermore, we plot also the true track reconstruction efficiency and contamination which are defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \mathrm{ true\,\, efficiency\,} &=&   M_{\rm trigvtx}\left(\pt{}\right)/G_{\rm trigvtx} \left(\pt{}\right), \\
  \mathrm{contamination} &=&  B\left(\pt{}\right)/ \left[  M_{\rm trigvtx}\left(\pt{}\right)+ B\left(\pt{}\right) \right] .
  \label{eq:Cont}
\end{eqnarray}
These ratios tell us what is the probability that an input MC charged primary track is reconstructed  and passes the selection  cuts   and
  what is the fraction of fake  primary tracks among all reconstructed tracks, respectively. 
  Overall reconstruction corrections, the true track reconstruction efficiency and contamination are shown in \fig{fig:eff_LHC13} for \ppb, \fig{fig:eff_LHC11a} for \pp \s=2.76\tev\ and \fig{fig:eff_7tev} for \pp \s=7\tev, respectively.
 
 \subsection{Trigger Efficiency}
In order to cross-check the efficiency correction we will compare charged track \pt{} spectra obtained
from this analysis with the results of the GSI group. For this purpose we have to normalize the \pt{}
spectrum per one inelastic event.

The total number of inelastic events equals
\begin{equation}
  N_{\rm inel} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int dz  I\left(z,\, n\right)
\end{equation}
where $I\left(z,\, n\right)$ gives the number of inelastic events having the number of contributors to a reconstructed
vertex equal to $n$ and the true MC vertex position in some range $(z,z+dz)$. The events where an interaction vertex was not reconstructed
have $n=0$ by definition.

The number of inelastic events with a reconstructed vertex ($n>0$) can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
I\left(z,\, n\right) = E^{*}_{\rm trigvtx}\left(z,\, n\right)\tilde{C}_{\rm vtx}\left(z,\,n\right)\,\tilde{C}_{\rm trig}\left(z,\,n\right)
\end{equation}
where $E^{*}_{\rm trigvtx}\left(z,\, n\right)$ stands for the measured number of triggered events with a reconstructed vertex
and $\tilde{C}_{\rm vtx}\left(z,\,n\right)$ and $\tilde{C}_{\rm trig}\left(z,\,n\right)$ denote corrections on
vertex reconstruction efficiency and trigger efficiency, respectively. Both correction factors are assessed
based on simulation
\begin{eqnarray}
 \tilde{C}_{\rm vtx} \left(z,\, n\right)&=& { E_{\rm trig} \left(z,\, n\right) \over  E_{\rm trigvtx} \left(z,\, n\right)},\\
 \tilde{C}_{\rm trig} \left(z,\, n\right)&=& { E_{\rm all} \left(z,\, n\right) \over  E_{\rm trig} \left(z,\, n\right)}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $E_{\rm class} \left(z,\, n\right)$ represents the number of inelastic events obtained from MC generator corresponding
to one of the event classes quoted in \tab{tab:class}.

In case that vertex was not reconstructed ($n=0$), we have
\begin{equation}
  I\left(z,\, 0\right) = E^{*}_{\rm trig}\left(0\right)  \alpha^{*} \left(z\right) F\left(z\right)\,\tilde{C}_{\rm trig} \left(z,\,0\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Here $E^{*}_{\rm trig}\left(0\right)$ gives the measured number of events which triggered but where an
interaction vertex was not reconstructed. These events are then distributed in the vertex diamond according to
the measured distribution of vertex positions
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*} \left(z\right)={ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} E^{*}_{\rm trigvtx}\left(z,\, n\right)   \over
                            \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int dz E^{*}_{\rm trigvtx}\left(z,\, n\right)}\,.
\end{equation}
The function $F(z)$ is a MC based correction which relates the shape of vertex distribution in events where a vertex
was not reconstructed and  the vertex distribution from reconstructed vertices
\begin{equation}
F\left(z\right) = { E_{\rm trig}(z,\,0)/\int dz  E_{\rm trig}(z,\,0)   \over
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} E_{\rm trigvtx}(z,\,n)/\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\int dz  E_{\rm trigvtx}(z,\,n)
}\,.
\end{equation}

Simulated and real events were divided into
6 multiplicity bins ( $n=0$, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to $\infty$) and
8 bins in $z$ vertex position (bin borders -10, -6, -3, -1.5, 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 10~cm).

\subsection{Comparison of charged track \pt{} spectra with the published result}
\label{sec:spectracomparison}

We compare our inclusive spectra to the published ALICE results for each data sets.
\ppb\ charged particle spectra from our analysis is compared with the published data~\cite{Abelev:2014dsa} in different bins of $\eta$ windows and good agreement is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:spectra_LHC13}.
\pp \s=2.76 and 7\tev spectra from our analysis is compared with the published data~\cite{Abelev:2013ala} and good agreement for 7 \tev\ and ~5\% difference in 2.76\tev\ is observed and shown
in Fig~\ref{fig:spectra_LHC11a} and \ref{fig:spectra_7tev}. Since there is no Raa or Hybrid cut for MC tuned AOD for 7\tev, we have used 3 different sets of cuts available and difference among the cut variations
are below few \% level.
